# Home_Automation_Using_UART_Bluetooth
This project demonstrates Bluetooth-controlled LED automation using the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller, programmed in Embedded C with Keil µVision IDE. An HC-05 Bluetooth module communicates with the microcontroller through UART, allowing a user to turn an LED ON or OFF by sending characters from a mobile device. The LED status is displayed on a 16x2 LCD, providing real-time feedback. The project is implemented and verified on actual hardware using an LPC2129 development kit, making it suitable for understanding UART communication, Bluetooth interfacing, and basic home automation concepts in embedded systems.
